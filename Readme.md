### Shops

- There are 2 different shops, 1 is the regular shop, which allows you to purchase things with coins (◊).
- The other is a token shop, which allows you to purchase shards using tokens (₪). If you have all the shards, you unlock the final battle
  - The shop is only accessible after finding a shard.

### Battles

- Each turn there will be 3 enemies fighting you, these enemies are in a "party"
- The player has 2 actions, with the available actions being:
    - Attack
    - Heal
- There is a small chance for the enemies to dodge your attack, meaning they take 0 damage. 
  - The player cannot dodge attacks.
- If an enemy dies, it has a chance to drop an item, which will automatically be added to the player's inventory.
- An enemy will always drop coins. The amount of coins scale slightly depending on the stage you are in.
- A boss will appear every 10 rounds and drop tokens(similar to coins but only dropped by bosses).
