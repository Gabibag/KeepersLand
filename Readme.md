# notes

we should also have locations, and make them so that each location gives a different modifier

But we want it to scale infinitely , so we can have the first 5 or 6 be hardcoded, 
such as "poisoned realm," which, say drops your health by a certain amount.
After the first few hardcoded elements, we can have each location be modified slightly using modifiers.
such as
- slightly
- increased
- decreased
- extra

Things such as this.
then we can have a main area element
- poison
- heal
- revive
- scale

And make then finally an element that affects only mobs
- immune
- resistant
- stronger
- powerless

The first one determines the scale of the effect the location gives, 
the second one gives the effect
the last one changes only the enemies
so, "slightly revived immune" would mean when the player dies, they revive
with a small amount of health, while the enemies would be immune to status effects
obviously the location can't say "slightly revived immune," so we can change it so specific
enemy effectors have a specific display name. [these will be nouns]
ex: powerless -> arena
    stronger  -> battlefield 
etc. 
while the location effects will be slightly modified
